# robo-init

robo-init is an extension to `cloud-init` from Canonical and adds some robot/hardware-specific functionality. If you have a robot which needs "hardware"-configuration, you can use `robo-init` to consistently set up things like:

- wifi and other network connections
- install packages
- create udev rules for serial or USB communications
- set up users and user groups
- configure RaspberryPi and RaspberryPi overlays

robo-init is an open source project and licensed under the BSD3 license. We're happy to collaborate!
